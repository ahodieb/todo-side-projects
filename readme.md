# covid-19-side-projects
Ideas for side projects to implement during the covid-19 lockdown

# Motivation
For the past 6 months or so I've been working on re-writing a legacy system and even though it is a challenging problem, it did not provide me with any challenging coding exercises, (i.e understanding the old system is hard, implementitation is failry straight forward). During the covid-10 lockdown my mental burnout got amplified. So this is my attempt to do some coding therapy :)

# Project Ideas 
## Datastructures
- HashMap
- LRU Cache
- Bloom filter

## Algorithms
- Hash functions (at least two)
- HyperLogLog

## System
- Zeitgeist
- Counter Service
- Ad Server

## CLI Tools
- Find
- Grep

## App
- Rubber stamp canvase
- Flutter app

## New Tech
- Idomatic unit tests in python
- Idomatic unit tests in go.
- Idomatic unit tests in Typescript/Javascript.
- Idomatic unit tests in for react (web ui)

## Implementations Deep dive
- [Guava Cache](https://github.com/google/guava/tree/master/guava/src/com/google/common/cache)
